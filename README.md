This is a six bit encoder with pre-defined encodings. It is much less efficient than the huffman encoder. If a file is read and the encodings are not defined, it will crash, where as the huffman encoder will automatically generate the encodings and acheive a higher degree of compression.

Building this was still an important excersize though, as it taught me the basics of encodings and compression. Hope you find this interesting!
